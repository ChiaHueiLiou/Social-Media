### Project Description
<p> Social media has changed our basic human needs and these baits are keeping us hooked and engaged. Twitter is a master at this game. Data from Twitter-storms is available in near real-time. This means we can learn about the big waves of thoughts and moods around the world as they arise. </p>

### Purpose
<p> The purpose of this object is to extract insights from social media data and be able to tell a story from the results. </p>

### Data
<p> For the analysis, I use the datas “USTrends.json”, "WWTrends.json" and "WeLoveTheEarth.json".</p>
<p> Twitter provides both global and local trends. “USTrends.json” and "WWTrends.json" contain topics that were hot in the United States(US) and worldwide(WW).</p>
<p> "WeLoveTheEarth.json" contains the posts data about the hot-trend hashtag "WeLoveTheEarth".
